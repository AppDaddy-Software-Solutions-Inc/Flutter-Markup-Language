    // Using Flexible() will allow max constraints to be satisfied.
    //  When using FlexFit.loose (Flexible() rather than Expanded(), the flex: factor needs to be dynamically calculated to represent the available space on the screen, minus the siblings max constraints once those constraints are exceeded
    // ie: if the screen width is 1200 and the max constraint of the 1 sibling is 600, the flex factor remains 1 on the unconstrained flexible and 1 on the constrained, as both can take up 50%.
    // if the screen width is 1800 the flex factor on the unconstrained must be 2, as 2/(2+1) is 66% of the available space, which the unconstrained must be given to allow it to take up the space that the constrained child will not use.
    //
    // This can potentially be calculated IF(there is /an unconstrained child in the main axis direction) with c: number of children, s: sum of siblings max constraints in the main axis direction, p: the size of the parent widget in the main axist direction, u: unconstrained children.
    //
    // ceil(((p-s)/p*100/(100-(p-s)/p*100))/u) : the ceiling will give us leeway so we do not have to adjust the unconstrained childrens flex factor outside of 1, since the flex factor cannot be a double.
    // This can also be calculated more simply by ceil(((p - s)/(s))/u)
    //
    // this becomes slightly more complex when flex factors are involved. We could convert this to a fraction as well to get more accurate flex factors rather than 1 for constrained children.
    // to use this with wrapping, ROW needs to only wrap when its width is less than the sum of its childrens min constraints

    // Set the Fit
    // tight: The child is forced to fill the available space. This is the default for the Expanded() widget.
    // loose: The child can be at most as large as the available space (but is allowed to be smaller). This is the default for the Flexible() widget.
