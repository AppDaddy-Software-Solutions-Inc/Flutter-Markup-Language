#### FML was designed with 3 provisions for developers
##### 1. **Prototype to Application**
As software developers we know the importance of prototyping but the gap between a non-functional prototype, a functional prototype and an actual application is wide. Solutions either sacrificed capability or time, FML is specifically designed to be able to create a non-functional prototype skeleton which can be fleshed into a functional prototype by additional syntax/parameters. The simplicity of the language requires only modifications/tweaks to complete an application. One huge advantage of this is that pieces of the application can be at different prototyping stages depending on the development while still working as a whole application, this optimization offers a lot of flexibility for design, development and testing.

##### 2. **Truly Cross Platform with a Single Codebase**
Write once, run everywhere, an age old ideal but we are confident in our no compromises approach. FML has built in all the platform implementations and UI idiosyncrasies for the developer. This promotes a more uniform application relieving the developer from being an expert on each platform and removing code duplication. Furthermore everything can be modified from looks to functionality if you wish to override the default behavior.

##### 3. **All the Simplicity Without the Sacrifice of Power**
The syntactic sugar FML provides for designing user interfaces with the functional power of data binding, logic interpretation and pre-defined events gives developers the best of both worlds. Run into a roadblock with something FML can't do? Let us know and we will make it possible. We don't believe FML should limit any application functionality, our goal is to make it faster and easier to achieve the same functionality as writing in a programming language.
